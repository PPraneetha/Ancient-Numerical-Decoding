# Ancient-Numerical-Decoding
"Katapayadi Sankhya" is an ancient Indian numerical notation system that encodes letters into numbers for easy memory commitment. There are 72 complete scales (or "ragas") in Indian classical music, meaning these 72 scales (or "ragas") have different versions of all the notes (or "swaras") of Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni, Sa. Some of these notes are flat, some are sharp. This will be reflected as such: "R1, R2, R3" or "N1, D2," for example. These notes are very similar to Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do found in Western classical music. Each scale is assigned a specific number anywhere from 1-72 and a specific name such as "Dheera Sankarabharanam". Based on the 1st two syllables of the name of the scale given by the user, the decoding system can calculate what scale this is, what its number is, and also what musical notes are sung in this scale.
